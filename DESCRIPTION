Description: Developed to deal with multi-locus genotype data, this package is especially designed for those panel which include different type of markers. Basic genetic parameters like allele frequency, genotype frequency, heterozygosity and Hardy-Weinberg test of mixed genetic data can be obtained.     In addition, a new test for mutual independence which is compatible for mixed genetic data is developed in this package.
